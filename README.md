### inspired by [DataWookie](https://github.com/DataWookie/MonthOfJulia/blob/master/README.md)

After hearing a couple of mates go on about how fast julia is, I have decided to embark on a month long expedition into the belly of the beast in search of speed and optimistaion and the golden glory of true O[logN] life. 

While it won't be as fancy as datawookie with an accompanying blog, each day will have both a Juypter Notebook and accompanying scripts.

## My month of Julia 
- Day One: Orientation and Strings
- Day Two: Arrays and List Comprehension 
- Day Three: Multidimesional Arrays and Types
