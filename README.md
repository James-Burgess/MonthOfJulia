# Month of Julia

### Inspired by [DataWookie](https://github.com/DataWookie/MonthOfJulia/blob/master/README.md)

After hearing a couple of mates go on about how fast julia is, I have decided to embark on a month long expedition into the belly of the beast in search of speed and optimistaion and the golden glory of true O[logN] life.

-[RTFM!](https://docs.julialang.org/en/stable/)

While it won't be as fancy as datawookie with an accompanying blog, each day will have both a Juypter Notebook and accompanying scripts.

## My month of Julia 
- Day 01: [Orientation and Strings](https://github.com/James-Burgess/MonthOfJulia/blob/master/notebooks/moj_01_Orientation_Strings.ipynb)

- Day 03: Multidimesional Arrays and Types
