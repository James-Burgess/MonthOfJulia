    "Types are a way of classifing datum in memory, allowing the complier to understand what data it is using can lead to much higher efficency, Julia will, by default, assign the type any to an untyped object in memory, this means that julia will allow polymorphism on objects but your speeds and rhobustness will greatly improve when you start typing objects and perhaps somewhat counterintuitively, often significantly simplify them.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Describing Julia in the lingo of [type systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_system), it is: dynamic, nominative and parametric. Generic types can be parameterized, and the hierarchical relationships between types are explicitly declared, rather than implied by compatible structure. One particularly distinctive feature of Julia's type system is that concrete types may not subtype each other: all concrete types are final and may only have abstract types as their supertypes.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Other high-level aspects of Julia's type system that should be mentioned up front are:\n",
    "1.   There is no division between object and non-object values: all values in Julia are true objects having a type that belongs to a single, fully connected type graph, all nodes of which are equally first-class as types.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.    There is no meaningful concept of a \"compile-time type\": the only type a value has is its actual type when the program is running. This is called a \"run-time type\" in object-oriented languages where the combination of static compilation with polymorphism makes this distinction significant.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.    Only values, not variables, have types â€“ variables are simply names bound to values.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.    Both abstract and concrete types can be parameterized by other types. They can also be parameterized by symbols, by values of any type for which isbits() returns true (essentially, things like numbers and bools that are stored like C types or structs with no pointers to other objects), and also by tuples thereof. Type parameters may be omitted when they do not need to be referenced or restricted.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Julia's type system is designed to be powerful and expressive, yet clear, intuitive and unobtrusive. Many Julia programmers may never feel the need to write code that explicitly uses types. Some kinds of programming, however, become clearer, simpler, faster and more robust with declared types.\n",
